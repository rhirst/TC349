		This is a section, appropriately labeled 'section' within the actual html file.  Normally, this space would be filled with all kinds of exciting content
		for the reader to enjoy; instead, they get this.  While the first reaction may instinctively be insurmountable anger and possibly even hatred 
		towards the creator of the site, they will soon find themselves filled with a deep, deep sorrow.  The realization that they will never behold the beautiful 
		content that could have been will wash over them, and they will know what is to be empty.

		This is the sidebar.  How great!  Unfortunately there's still nothing really here.  I'm really sorry, this is so embarrassing.
