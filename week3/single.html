		This is a section, appropriately labeled 'section' within the actual html file.  Normally, this space would be filled with all kinds of exciting content
		for the reader to enjoy; instead, they get this.  While the first reaction may instinctively be insurmountable anger and possibly even hatred 
		towards the creator of the site, they will soon find themselves filled with a deep, deep sorrow.  The realization that they will never behold the beautiful 
		content that could have been will wash over them, and they will know what is to be empty.
